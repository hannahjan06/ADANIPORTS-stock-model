📈 Adani Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the stock price of Adani Group companies based on historical market data. The objective is to provide a reliable estimate of future stock values using statistical and ML-based techniques.

1. 🔎 Project Overview

Stock markets are inherently volatile and influenced by numerous factors such as market sentiment, global indices, and company-specific performance.

This project applies regression-based machine learning models to capture these patterns and predict stock movements, with a focus on Adani Enterprises Ltd. (and other Adani stocks if included).

2. 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of historical stock data, typically obtained from NSE/BSE or Yahoo Finance. Features include:

Date → Trading date

Open → Opening price

High → Highest price of the day

Low → Lowest price of the day

Close → Closing price

Volume → Number of shares traded

(Target variable: Close price)

3. ⚙️ Methodology
🔧 Data Preprocessing
